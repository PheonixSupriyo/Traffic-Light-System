# Traffic-Light-System
This is designing of an automated 3-road intersection traffic light system using Arduino. Traffic signals are designed to ensure an orderly flow of traffic, provide an opportunity for pedestrians or vehicles to cross an intersection and help reduce the number of conflicts between vehicles entering intersections from different directions. 
This report proposes a technique to control the traffic light system automatically by a microcontroller and it will ensure safety and proper time interval to stop, wait and pass for every vehicle.
